# nodekeeper

nodekeeper is a CLI tool that helps build Node.Js applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

It does **not** require *any* additional changes to your code during developement. It is a replacement wrapper for `node`. To use `nodekeeper`, replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.
